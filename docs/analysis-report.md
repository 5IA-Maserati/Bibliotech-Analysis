# **Analytical Report: Evaluation of User Experience and Market Potential for School Platforms**

Date: December 12, 2025

Subject: Analysis of Survey Results on Digital Library and Used Book Marketplace

Sample: 114–115 respondents (Students, Administrative Staff, Teachers)

---

## **1. General Summary**

The survey revealed a very strong latent demand for the digitalization of school services. There is a clear opportunity to develop an integrated platform that offers both digital lending and a secure marketplace for used books.

The main driver for platform adoption is not only economic convenience, but **security and specificity** (search by class/school). The average user is willing to pay a small commission in exchange for guarantees against fraud, which represents the main barrier to entry.

## **2. Service Analysis: Digital Library**

Reception toward the introduction of a digital library is extremely positive, indicating that users are ready for a technological transition.

* **Interest and Adoption:** 66.4% of respondents consider digital book lending from home “Very useful,” and 61.4% see its integration alongside the traditional system as “A major improvement.”
* **Frequency of Use:** Recurring usage is expected, with 47.4% estimating weekly access, suggesting the platform would become a daily study tool rather than a sporadic one.
* **Core Features:** The most critical requested feature is **advanced content search** (68.4%).
* **Support Model:** Users favor autonomy. The majority prefer FAQs/online guides (41.2%) or email support (38.6%) rather than real-time interactions such as live chat.

## **3. Market Analysis: Used Book Buying and Selling**

The current market is fragmented between physical channels (43.9%) and informal/social channels (14%). There is significant room to centralize these transactions.

### **3.1 Willingness to Use and Business Model**

* **Interest:** 57% of the sample declares being “Very” or “Extremely” interested in a specialized platform.
* **Monetization:** A crucial data point for project sustainability is that **50.9% of users are willing to pay a commission under 5%** to receive service guarantees. An additional 9.6% would accept even higher commissions (5–10%).
* **Expected Savings:** Most buyers (42.1%) expect a discount between 31% and 50% off the cover price.

### **3.2 Preferred Logistics**

There is no clear winner in logistics, suggesting the need for a hybrid approach:

* **Tracked shipping:** 30.7%
* **In-person exchange:** 27.2%
* **Lockers / pickup points:** 14.9%
* *Qualitative note:* Some users explicitly suggest the option to “pick up at school.”

## **4. Risk Factors**

Trust is the main obstacle to online peer-to-peer transactions.

* **Risk Perception:** 73.6% of users have a “Medium” or “High” level of concern regarding fraud. Qualitative comments reinforce this sentiment (“If they scam me, we’ll go get them”).
* **Mitigation Features:** To counter this fear, users request:

  1. **Detailed descriptions and real photos** of the book’s condition (39.5%).
  2. **Refund guarantee** (32.5%).
  3. **User feedback/ratings** (21.9%).

---

## **5. School-Specific Focus**

A key differentiator compared to generic marketplaces (such as eBay or Vinted) is school “verticalization.”

* 59.7% consider it “Extremely” or “Very important” to filter books by **school, class, or field of study**. This reduces purchasing errors (wrong editions), a problem also reported by teachers.

## **6. Strategic Recommendations**

Based on the collected data, it is recommended to proceed with development by focusing on the following pillars:

1. **Transaction Protection (Escrow):** Implement a payment system that holds funds until receipt (or exchange) is confirmed. This justifies the 5% commission users are willing to pay.
2. **Mandatory Photos:** Require the upload of real photos showing any defects in the book, as this is the most requested feature for evaluating used items.
3. **Integration with School Databases:** Filtering by “Class/Section” is essential.
4. **Notification System:** Implement automatic alerts (email/SMS) when a searched book becomes available, a feature requested by 55.3% of users when the item is not immediately available.
5. **Flexible Logistics:** Do not impose shipping only. Facilitate in-person meetings (possibly in “safe zones” such as the school itself) to satisfy the 27.2% who prefer hand-to-hand exchange.
