## Objective
Evaluate the implementation of an online library survey system to collect user feedback efficiently.

## Proposed Solution
Develop a web-based survey platform integrated with the existing Bibliotech system. The platform will allow users to answer surveys directly from their accounts, and results will be stored in a database for analysis.

## Technical Feasibility
- [x] Technologies available: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB
- [x] Skills required: Web development, database management, security basics
- [x] Risks or limitations: Integration with legacy systems might require additional APIs; user authentication must be secure

## Economic Feasibility
- [x] Estimated cost: $3,500 for development and hosting
- [x] Resource requirements: 2 developers for 4 weeks
- [x] ROI or value: Faster collection of user feedback, improved data accuracy, reduced manual work

## Operational Feasibility
- [x] Workflow impact: Minimal disruption; system will be used in parallel with existing methods during transition
- [x] Team readiness: Development team available and experienced
- [x] Stakeholder support: Library management supports the initiative

## Risks
- [x] Risk 1: Delays in development due to unforeseen technical issues
- [x] Risk 2: Low user participation in surveys
- [x] Risk 3: Security vulnerabilities if authentication is improperly configured

## Recommendations / Next Steps
- Implement a prototype and run a pilot survey
- Train staff on using the new system
- Monitor user engagement and system performance
