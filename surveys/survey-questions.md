# Digital Library & Second-Hand Textbook Platform Survey

## Project Overview
This survey was designed to gather insights from the educational community regarding the implementation of a **Digital Library** and a specialized **Online Marketplace for Used Textbooks**. The goal is to understand user needs, accessibility requirements, and preferences for digital academic services.

## Survey Structure
The questionnaire is divided into two main sections:
1. **Digital Library Implementation:** Assessing interest in digital lending, device compatibility, and desired content types.
2. **Second-Hand Marketplace:** Investigating buying/selling habits for school books and interest in a secure, school-focused transaction platform.
